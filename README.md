# Tic Tac Toe

## Meet Alex!
Alex is an AI designed to never lose a tic tac toe game!

## How to play!

To play, download **game.py** and **ai.py**. **game.py** is what you will run in your terminal to play tic tac toe! **ai.py** is where all of Alex's logic is found. **ai.py** can be run to test single move outcomes! Costom boards can be stored within **ai.py**'s main function.

Here are the indexes for each position on the board.
 0 | 1 | 2
--- --- ---
 3 | 4 | 5
--- --- ---
 6 | 7 | 8

For example, 0 plays the top left while 7 plays the middle bottom.

__Settings__
You can control how hard you want Alex to play *(or search)*. Within the main function found in **game.py**, there is a variable called *difficulty*. Defaulty, this is set to 1. This indicates the the board will go as DEEP as it can to find a winning position. Difficulty 1 is the hardest setting!

Recommended difficulty settings:
* *difficulty = 8* = CHILDRENS PLAY
* *difficulty = 4* = EASY
* *difficulty = 2* = HARD
* *difficulty = 1* = IMPOSSIBLE


#### EXTRA:
If Alex beats you on *difficulty = 1*, let me know! It is not suppose to lose! ;)
